## About
 * Sudoku  is a logic-based, combinatorial number placement puzzle game. The objective of
this game is to fill a 𝑁 × 𝑁 grid with digits so that every row, column and inner box is filled with
number from 1 to 𝑁 without duplicates. 
 * In most situations, a Sudoku game should have a unique solution. However,
there can be cases that a Sudoku game has multiple solutions. Usually a game with multiple
solution is considered to be more difficult than the one that has a unique solution.
 * The engine is made using Tkinter library in Python which provides a user-friendly GUI. The algorithm which solves the puzzle is a backtracking algorithm with a 9^𝑁 time complexity, where 𝑁 represents the number of empty fields.

## Key Features

  - The user can choose between 3 types of levels: easy, medium and hard.
* Randomly generated sudoku boards
